# MIDAS Website Color Analysis

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the color schemes used in the MIDAS marketing agency website for both light and dark themes. The website uses a sophisticated color system based on HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values defined as CSS variables.

## Theme Implementation
The website implements theming using Next.js with the `next-themes` library. Theme switching is handled by the `ThemeToggle` component, which allows users to select between light, dark, and system preferences.

1. **Light Theme (Default)**
   - Base: Deep blue-black background with near-white text
   - Accent: Vibrant gold/yellow for emphasis and interactive elements
   - Supporting: Muted blue-gray tones for secondary elements
   - Charts: Diverse palette of coral, teal, dark blue, yellow-green, and orange

2. **Dark Theme**
   - Base: Very dark brown-black background with warm off-white text
   - Accent: Same vibrant gold/yellow as light theme for consistency
   - Supporting: Dark brown-gray tones for secondary elements
   - Charts: Different palette of blue, green-teal, orange, purple, and pink-red

### Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast between background and text colors in both themes
- Consistent use of the gold/yellow accent color across themes for brand recognition
- Different chart color palettes optimized for each theme's background

## Conclusion
The MIDAS website employs a sophisticated color system that maintains brand consistency while providing appropriate contrast and visual hierarchy in both light and dark themes. The primary gold/yellow accent color serves as a distinctive brand element across both themes, while the supporting colors are adjusted to complement the different base colors of each theme.

The color scheme effectively communicates a premium, professional aesthetic appropriate for a marketing agency, with the gold/yellow accent adding energy and distinctiveness to the design.
