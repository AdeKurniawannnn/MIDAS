# TASK: Create comprehensive unit tests for UI simplification changes
# TYPE: test
# PRIORITY: high
# TIMEOUT: 30

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for the UI simplification changes made to the EnhancedOrionClient component, ensuring all new functionality works correctly and removed elements are properly eliminated.

## Context
The EnhancedOrionClient component has undergone significant UI simplification:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed redundant buttons**: "Add Keyword", "Quick Scrape", separate platform buttons
2. **Added unified dropdown**: "Start New Scraping" with platform selection
3. **Moved "Add Keyword"**: Now contextually placed in data section headers
4. **Removed floating action button**: Eliminated duplicate functionality

### Key Files:
- Component: `src/features/orion/components/enhanced-orion-client.tsx`
- Test location: `src/features/orion/components/__tests__/enhanced-orion-client.test.tsx`

### Test Requirements:
- Use React Testing Library and Jest
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Include accessibility testing
- Mock external dependencies properly

## Deliverables
1. **Complete test file**: `enhanced-orion-client.test.tsx` with comprehensive test coverage
2. **Test scenarios**:
   - Dropdown menu renders correctly
   - Platform selection triggers correct handlers
   - Contextual "Add Keyword" buttons appear in correct locations
   - Removed buttons are NOT rendered
   - User interactions work as expected
   - Component handles props correctly
   - Accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass with `npm run test`
- Test coverage includes all new functionality
- Tests verify removal of old elements
- Tests follow React Testing Library best practices
- Component behavior matches UI specifications exactly

## Implementation Notes
- Mock QuickAddKeywordModal component if needed
- Mock ResizableSidebar component
- Test dropdown menu interactions thoroughly
- Verify correct platform type handling
- Test responsive behavior if applicable
